# Angara

Angara: the modelling environment.

## Angara.Html

### Build instructions

Angara.Html uses grunt and bower to download scripts that will be references by produced HTML pages displaying .NET objects. 
To enable that, before the first build of the project you should go to the Angara.Html folder and run
```
npm install
```

Then you can open sln/Angara.Html/Angara.Html.sln in Visual Studio and build it.
